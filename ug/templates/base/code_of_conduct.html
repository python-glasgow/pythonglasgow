<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events
are required to agree with the following code of conduct.
Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are
expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a
safe environment for everybody.</p>

<p><em>tl;dr: Be excellent with each other</em></p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>You have our contact details in the emails we&#39;ve sent.</p>

<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

<p>Our events is dedicated to providing a harassment-free events
experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of
events participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is
not appropriate for any events venue, including talks, workshops,
parties, Twitter and other online media. Events participants
violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
events <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the events
organisers.</p>

<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to
gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected
to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images,
activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers)
should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the events
organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from the events with no
refund.</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of
events staff immediately. Events staff can be identified as
they&#39;ll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>

<p>Events staff will be happy to help participants contact
hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts,
or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe
for the duration of the events. We value your attendance.</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at events and
workshop venues and events-related social events.</p>

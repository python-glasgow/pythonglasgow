<h1>Python Glasgow Code of Conduct</h1>
<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout our events. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>
<h2>Need Help?</h2>
<p>The following people should be able to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Event Organiser</strong> <em>(usually the person who sent emails organising the event)</em>. Probably best to either contact them in person, or via email.</li>
<li><strong>Dougal Matthews</strong> (Contact in person or via <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#100;&#111;&#117;&#103;&#97;&#108;&#64;&#100;&#111;&#117;&#103;&#97;&#108;&#109;&#97;&#116;&#116;&#104;&#101;&#119;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">email</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Quick Version</h2>
<p>Our events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for these events, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organisers.</p>
<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event organisers immediately.</p>
<p>Organisers will be happy to help participants contact local security or law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at event venues and event-related social events.</p>

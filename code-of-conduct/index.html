sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organisers.</p>

<h4>Anti-Harassment Policy</h4>
<p>Our Python Meetup Community is committed to providing a safe and
harassment-free experience for all participants, regardless of sex, gender,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion, or any
other characteristic.</p>
<p>This Anti-harassment policy applies to all community spaces, including physical
meetups, online platforms, social media, and any other communication channels
associated with the community.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Harassment</strong>: Harassment includes offensive comments or actions related to
sex, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion, or
any other characteristic. Harassment also includes unwelcome sexual advances,
intimidation, stalking, photography or recording without consent, sustained
disruption of talks or other events, and any other inappropriate behaviour that
creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Respectful Communication</strong>: Engage in respectful and constructive
communication. Treat others with kindness, empathy, and respect. Disagreements
are bound to happen, but it is important to do so respectfully, focusing on the
issues rather than attacking individuals.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Inclusive Language</strong>: Use inclusive language and avoid any offensive or
exclusionary comments, jokes, or imagery that could create discomfort or harm
to others. Be mindful of the impact of your words and actions on others, even
if they were unintentional.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Personal Boundaries</strong>: Respect personal boundaries of others. Do not touch
others without their consent. Be mindful of personal space and do not engage in
any behavior that makes others uncomfortable.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Reporting and Enforcement</strong>: If you witness or experience harassment or any
violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it to the organizers
immediately. Reports can be made in person, via email, or through any other
official communication channels. All reports will be kept confidential and will
be reviewed and addressed promptly. Appropriate actions will be taken, which
may include warnings, expulsion from the event or community, or banning from
future events.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Consequences</strong>: Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in
disciplinary actions deemed appropriate by the organizers, including but not
limited to warnings, temporary or permanent bans from the community, and
involvement of law enforcement if necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
